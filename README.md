# ☁️ Cloud Q&A Knowledge Hub

Welcome to my personal **Cloud Q&A Knowledge Hub** — a collection of real questions, answers, and insights I've gathered while exploring cloud technologies, industry trends, and real-world challenges.  
This repo captures what I’ve learned through curiosity, research, and conversations about **Azure**, **AWS**, and the cloud industry as a whole.

---

## 🌍 Purpose
This repository serves as my personal space to:
- Record **questions and answers** I’ve asked or researched about cloud computing.  
- Track **real incidents and news**, such as major outages or technology shifts.  
- Understand **why companies adopt or avoid cloud** and what challenges appear during migrations.  
- Build a growing, well-organized **cloud knowledge base** over time.  

> 💡 “Every question deepens understanding — this repo is where my cloud curiosity lives.”

## ✍️ Example Entry

**Question:** Why do so many cloud outages relate to DNS?  
**Answer:**  
> DNS acts as the address book for cloud infrastructure. When it fails, services cannot locate one another, causing widespread downtime.  
> Cloud providers rely heavily on internal DNS systems, so even a small configuration issue can cascade globally.  
> **Mitigation:** use redundant DNS providers, monitor health checks, and set short TTLs for faster recovery.
